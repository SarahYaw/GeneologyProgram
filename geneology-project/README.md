Welcome to my geneology database! I made this for a family member of mine who is interested in preserving the research they've done for future generations in an easy to use and maintain website so I've made this web application. It's pre-populated with sample data not meant to represent any real person for safety, but I'll detail how to add and maintain your own entries :)

This project is made in vue 3 so you will need to have that installed. I also reccomend using Volar vue extension if you're using VS Code like I am.
